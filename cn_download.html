				<h6>Title: The Relation of Retinal Vessel Caliber to the
					Incidence and Progression of Diabetic Retinopathy XIX: The
					Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy</h6>
				Date: 2004<br> Authors: Ronald Klein, MD, MPH; Barbara E. K.
				Klein, MD; Scot E. Moss, MA<br> <br> Abstract: Objective:
				To describe the relation of retinal arteriolar and venular caliber
				to the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in people
				with type1 diabetes mellitus.<br> <br> Design: Incidence
				findings in a population-based study of diabetic retinopathy in
				Wisconsin. Participants included 996 persons diagnosed as having
				diabetes mellitus before 30 years of age who took insulin and
				underwent the baseline examination, 891 in the 4-year follow-up, 765
				in the 10-year follow-up, and634 in the 14-year follow-up. Retinal
				photographs of 7 standard fields were taken at all examinations.
				Computer-assisted grading was performed from a digitized image of
				field 1 to determine the average diameter of retinal arterioles and
				venules and their ratio. Main outcome measures included incidence
				and progression of retinopathy, incidence of proliferative
				retinopathy, and macular edema.<br> <br> Results: While
				adjusting for other factors, larger arteriolar (relative risk[RR]
				for the fourth vs first quartile range, 2.04; 95% confidence
				interval[CI], 1.20-3.47; test of trend, P = .008) and venular
				diameters (RR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.37-3.95; test of trend, P = .005)
				were associated with greater 4-year progression of retinopathy.
				Larger venular diameters (RR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.50-12.19; test of
				trend, P = .006) but not arteriolar diameters were associated with
				greater 4-year incidence of proliferative retinopathy. In
				multivariable analyses, arteriolar and venular calibers were not
				associated with the 4-yearincidence of retinopathy. While adjusting
				for other factors, arteriolar and venular calibers were not
				associated with incidence of macular edema at 4years. There were few
				associations of arteriolar or venular caliber with the10- or 14-year
				incidence or the progression of retinopathy.<br> <br>
				Conclusions: Larger arteriolar and venular caliber, independent of
				retinopathy severity level, is related to the progression of
				retinopathy, and larger venular caliber is associated with the
				4-year incidence of proliferative retinopathy. Caliber of retinal
				vessels is not associated with incident retinopathy. These data
				suggest a quantitative measure of retinal vascular caliber provides
				additional information regarding risk for progression of
				retinopathy.<br> <br> Published: Klein, R., Klein, B. E.,

				<h6>Title: Retinal Vessel Diameters and Risk of Hypertension</h6>
				Date: 2006<br> Authors: M. Kamran Ikram, Jacqueline C.M.
				Witteman, Johannes R. Vingerling, Monique M.B. Breteler, Albert
				Hofman and Paulus T.V.M. de Jong<br> <br> Abstract:
				Generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing is an important sign of
				systemic hypertension, and a lower arteriolar: venular diameter
				ratio predicts the risk of hypertension. We investigated whether
				this association was based on arteriolar or venular diameters or
				both. This study was based on the prospective population– based
				Rotterdam Study (1990–1993) and included 1900 participants (55 years
				of age) of whom 739 persons had normal blood pressure (systolic 120
				mm Hg and diastolic 80 mm Hg) and 1161 prehypertension (systolic 120
				to 139 mm Hg or diastolic 80 to 89 mm Hg). For each participant,
				retinal arteriolar and venular diameters were measured on digitized
				images of 1 eye. After a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, 808 persons
				developed hypertension, defined as either systolic blood pressure
				140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or use of
				antihypertensive medication. Adjusted for age, gender, follow-up
				time, body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, total and
				high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and
				intima–media thickness, arteriolar narrowing was associated with an
				increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio per SD: 1.38; 95% CI,
				1.23 to 1.55); for venular narrowing this was less striking (OR:
				1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.32). Each SD decrease in the arteriolar:
				venular diameter ratio significantly increased the risk of
				hypertension by 24%. To examine the effect of baseline blood
				pressure, we stratified persons into those with “normal blood
				pressure” or “prehypertension.” Within these strata, arteriolar
				narrowing was still related to incident hypertension. These data
				show that both retinal arteriolar and venular narrowing may precede
				the development of systemic hypertension. (Hypertension. 2006;

				<h6>Title: Retinal vessel diameter and cardiovascular
					mortality: pooled data analysis from two older populations</h6>
				Date: 2007 <br>Authors: Jie Jin Wang, Gerald Liew, Ronald
				Klein, Elena Rochtchina, Michael D. Knudtson, Barbara E.K. Klein,
				Tien Yin Wong, George Burlutsky, and Paul Mitchell<br> <br>
				Abstract: Aims: The retinal microvasculature may reflect
				pre-clinical changes in the cerebral and coronary micro-
				circulations. We assessed whether smaller retinal arterioles and
				larger venules predicted coronary heart disease (CHD)- and
				stroke-mortality.<br> <br> Methods and results: We pooled
				data from the Beaver Dam Eye Study (n 1⁄4 4926, aged 43–86) and the
				Blue Mountains Eye Study (n 1⁄4 3654, aged 49–97). Retinal vessel
				diameters were measured from digitized retinal photographs. Change
				point models were used to assess and document the existence of
				threshold effects. We defined smaller arterioles as diameters within
				the narrowest quintile and larger venules as diameters within the
				widest quintile, with other quintiles as the reference. Of 8550
				participants, 7494 (88%) with complete data were included, of whom
				653 died from CHD and 299 from stroke over 10–12 years follow-up.
				After multivariable adjustment, each standard deviation (SD)
				increase in arteriolar diameter, or SD decrease in venular diameter,
				was not found to be significantly associated with either
				CHD-mortality or stroke-mortality. However, smaller arterioles
				[hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–1.62] and
				larger venules (HR 1.24, CI 1.02–1.52), predicted increased risk of
				CHD-mortality. These associations were mainly evident among persons
				aged 43–69 (smaller arterioles: HR 1.70, CI 1.27–2.28; larger
				venules: HR 1.41, CI 1.06–1.89). Smaller arterioles (HR 1.64, CI
				1.00–2.67) and larger venules (HR 1.53, CI 0.94–2.47) were also
				associated with an increased risk of stroke-mortality among persons
				aged 43–69. <br> <br> Conclusion: Retinal vessel diameter
				may predict risk of CHD and stroke deaths in middle-aged persons. <br>

				<h6>Title: Retinal Vascular Caliber: Systemic, Environmental,
					and Genetic Associations</h6>
				Date: 2009 <br> Authors: Cong Sun, MD, MPH, Jie Jin Wang, MMed,
				PhD, David A. Mackey, MD, Tien Y. Wong, MD, PhD<br> <br>
				Abstract: Quantitative studies of retinal vascular caliber using new
				computer-assisted retinal imaging systems have allowed physicians
				and researchers to understand the influence of systemic,
				environmental, and genetic factors on retinal vascular caliber.
				Retinal vascular caliber changes reflect cumulative response to
				aging, cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, nitric
				oxide–dependent endothelial dysfunction, and other processes. Recent
				epidemiological studies have shown that changes in retinal
				arteriolar and venular caliber size may reflect the differential
				effects of a range of systemic, environmental, and genetic risk
				factors. Narrower retinal arteriolar caliber and smaller
				arteriovenous ratio are associated with older age; higher levels of
				past, current, and future blood pressure and obesity; and predict
				the incidence of diabetes and coronary heart disease. Wider retinal
				venular caliber, in contrast, is associated with younger age;
				impaired fasting glucose and diabetes; dyslipidemia; obesity;
				systemic marker of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and
				cigarette smoking; and predicts the risk of stroke and coronary
				heart disease. New data from family and twin studies indicate a
				significant genetic contribution to retinal vascular caliber, an
				area that is under investigation. Elucidating the complete range of
				systemic, environmental, and genetic factors linked with retinal
				vascular caliber changes may provide critical insight into the
				etiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of early vascular
				disease not only in the eye but elsewhere in the body.<br> <br>

				Date: 2009 <br> Authors: McGeechan K, Liew G, Macaskill P,

				<br> Background: Retinal vessel caliber may be a novel marker
				of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, the sex-specific
				effect, magnitude of association, and effect independent of
				traditional CHD disease risk factors remain unclear.<br> <br>
				Purpose: To determine the association between retinal vessel caliber
				and risk for CHD.<br> <br> Data Sources: Relevant studies
				in any language identified through MEDLINE (1950 to June 2009) and
				EMBASE (1950 to June 2009) databases.<br> <br> Study
				Selection: Studies were included if they examined a general
				population, measured retinal vessel caliber from retinal
				photographs, and documented CHD risk factors and incident CHD
				events.<br> <br> Data Extraction: 6 population-based
				prospective cohort studies provided data for individual participant
				meta-analysis.<br> <br> Data Synthesis: Proportional
				hazards models, adjusted for traditional CHD risk factors, were
				constructed for retinal vessel caliber and incident CHD in women and
				men. Among 22Â 159 participants who were free of CHD and followed
				for 5 to 14 years, 2219 (10.0%) incident CHD events occurred.
				Retinal vessel caliber changes (wider venules and narrower
				arterioles) were each associated with an increased risk for CHD in
				women (pooled multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios, 1.16 [95% CI,
				1.06 to 1.26] per 20-Î¼m increase in venular caliber and 1.17 [CI,
				1.07 to 1.28] per 20-Î¼m decrease in arteriolar caliber) but not in
				men (1.02 [CI, 0.94 to 1.10] per 20-Î¼m increase in venular caliber
				and 1.02 [CI, 0.95 to 1.10] per 20-Î¼m decrease in arteriolar
				caliber). Women without hypertension or diabetes had higher hazard
				ratios.<br> <br> Limitation: Error in the measurement of
				retinal vessel caliber and Framingham variables was not taken into
				account.<br> <br> Conclusion: Retinal vessel caliber
				changes were independently associated with an increased risk for CHD
				events in women.<br> <br> Published: McGeechan K, Liew G,

				<h6>Title: Retinal Vascular Signs: A Window to the Heart?</h6>
				Date: 2011 <br> Authors: Gerald Liew, Jie Jin Wang<br> <br>
				Abstract: There is increasing recognition that coronary
				microvascular dysfunction also plays an important role in coronary
				heart disease. Little is known about this aspect of coronary heart
				disease due to difficulties in studying the coronary
				microcirculation directly. The retina is a unique site where the
				microcirculation can be imaged directly, providing an opportunity to
				study in vivo the structure and pathology of the human circulation
				and the possibility of detecting changes in microvasculature
				relating to the development of cardiovascular disease. This review
				covers the recent progress in research linking retinal vascular
				signs to coronary heart disease, and finds accumulating evidence
				that retinal vascular signs may provide a window into the health of
				the coronary microvasculature. The most widely studied signs,
				arteriolar narrowing, and more recently, venular dilation, are
				likely associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease in
				women, independent of traditional risk factors. Attempts to improve
				coronary heart disease risk prediction by incorporating retinal
				vessel caliber size into risk prediction scores complementing
				traditional algorithms such as the Framingham risk scores have so
				far been disappointing. Research is ongoing into the predictive
				utility of other retinal vascular signs. Retinal photography
				provides long-lasting records that enable monitoring of longitudinal
				changes in these retinal signs and vascular health. <br> <br>

				<h6>Title: Exercise-induced alterations of retinal vessel
					diameters and cardiovascular risk reduction in obesity.</h6>
				Date: 2011 <br> Authors: Hanssen H1, Nickel T, Drexel V, Hertel
				G, Emslander I, Sisic Z, Lorang D, Schuster T, Kotliar KE, Pressler
				A, Schmidt-Trucksäss A, Weis M, Halle M<br> <br> Abstract:
				<br> <br> Background: The retinal microcirculation is
				affected early in the process of atherosclerosis and retinal vessel
				caliber is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. Obesity is
				associated with vascular dysfunction. Here, we investigate the
				effect of regular exercise on retinal vessel diameters in lean and
				obese runners. We analyze a possible link to alterations of the
				nitric oxide (NO)-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) pathway.<br>
				<br> Methods: Retinal vessel diameters were assessed by means
				of a static vessel analyzer (SVA-T) in 15 obese athletes (OA), 14
				lean amateur athletes (AA) and 17 lean elite athletes (EA) following
				a 10-week training program. ADMA serum levels were detected by ELISA
				and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) -1/-2
				mRNA-expression in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) was analyzed
				by real time PCR.<br> <br> Results: At baseline, the mean
				(±SD) arteriolar to venular diameter ratio (AVR) was impaired in
				obese (OA: 0.81±0.05) compared to lean subjects (AA: 0.87±0.07; EA:
				0.94±0.05). The individual fitness levels correlated with AVR
				(rho=+0.66; P&lsaquo;0.001) and the training program improved AVR in
				all groups (P&lsaquo;0.001), normalizing AVR in the obese (OA:
				0.86±0.1). A training-induced arteriolar dilatation was found in OA
				(P=0.01), which was accompanied by a significant decrease of ADMA
				levels (0.56±0.12-0.46±0.12 μ moll (-1); P&lsaquo;0.028). DDAH-1
				mRNA levels in PBMC increased in all groups (P&lsaquo;0.01).<br>
				<br> Conclusions: Cardiovascular fitness and body composition
				affect retinal vessel diameters. Regular exercise reverses the
				subclinical impairment of the retinal microvasculature in obesity by
				inducing retinal arteriolar dilatation. The NO/ADMA pathway may play
				a key role in the training-induced improvement of microvascular
				function, which has the potential to counteract progression of small
				vessel disease.<br> <br> Published: Hanssen H1, Nickel T,

				<br> Abstracts: Why do more intelligent people live healthier
				and longer lives? One possibility is that intelligence tests assess
				health of the brain, but psychological science has lacked technology
				to evaluate this hypothesis. Digital retinal imaging, a new,
				noninvasive method to visualize microcirculation in the eye, may
				reflect vascular conditions in the brain. We studied the association
				between retinal vessel caliber and neuropsychological functioning in
				the representative Dunedin birth cohort. Wider venular caliber was
				associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning at midlife,
				independently of potentially confounding factors. This association
				was not limited to any specific test domain and extended to
				informants’ reports of cohort members’ cognitive difficulties in
				everyday life. Moreover, wider venular caliber was associated with
				lower childhood IQ tested 25 years earlier. The findings indicate
				that retinal venular caliber may be an indicator of
				neuropsychological health years before the onset of dementing
				diseases and suggest that digital retinal imaging may be a useful
				investigative tool for psychological science.<br> <br>

				<h6>Title: Blood flow in glaucoma</h6>
				Date: 2005 <br> Author: Matthias C Grieshaber, Josef Flammer<br>
				<br> Abstract: Purpose of review: Glaucoma, one of the leading
				causes of blindness in the world, is characterized by progressive
				visual field loss and distinctive excavation of the optic nerve
				head. Although elevated intraocular pressure is the major risk
				factor, there is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of
				glaucoma is also linked to altered ocular blood flow. This review
				summarizes the recent publications relevant to blood flow in
				glaucoma. Recent findings: Several studies indicate that a perfusion
				instability, rather than a steady reduction of ocular blood flow,
				might contribute to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The main cause of
				the instability is a disturbed autoregulation in the context of a
				general vascular dysregulation. The underlying mechanism of such a
				vascular dysregulation is not known. A dysfunction of both the
				autonomic nervous system and vascular endothelial cells is
				discussed. Summary: The mechanical and vascular theories are not
				mutually exclusive; on the contrary, a vascular dysregulation
				increases the susceptibility to intraocular pressure.
				Therapeutically, therefore, both an intraocular pressure reduction
				and an improvement of the ocular blood flow might be considered. <br>

					Glaucoma?</h6>

				Abstract: The need of blood flow to different organs varies rapidly
				over time which is why there is sophisticated local regulation of
				blood flow. The term dysregulation simply means that blood flow is
				not properly adapted to this need. Dysregulative mechanisms can lead
				to an over- or under perfusion. A steady over perfusion may be less
				critical for long-term damage. A constant under perfusion, however,
				can lead to some tissue atrophy or in extreme situations to
				infarction. Unstable perfusion (under perfusion followed by
				reperfusion) leads to oxidative stress. There are a number of causes
				that lead to local or systemic vascular dysregulation. Systemic
				dysregulation can be primary or secondary of nature. A secondary
				dysregulation is due to other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
				arthritis, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematodes,
				multiple sclerosis, colitis ulcerosa, or Crohns disease. Patients
				with a secondary vascular dysregulation normally have a high level
				of circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1). This increased level of ET-1
				leads to a reduction of blood flow both in the choroid and the optic
				nerve head but has little influence on autoregulation. In contrast,
				primary vascular dysregulation has little influence on baseline
				ocular blood flow but interferes with autoregulation. This, in turn,
				leads to unstable oxygen supply, which seems to be a relevant
				component in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. <br>

				<h6>Title: The primary vascular dysregulation syndrome:
					implications for eye diseases</h6>
				Date: 2013 <br> Author: Flammer, J., Konieczka, K., & Flammer,
				A. J.<br> <br> Abstract: Vascular dysregulation refers to
				the regulation of blood flow that is not adapted to the needs of the
				respective tissue. We distinguish primary vascular dysregulation
				(PVD, formerly called vasospastic syndrome) and secondary vascular
				dysregulation (SVD). Subjects with PVD tend to have cold
				extremities, low blood pressure, reduced feeling of thirst, altered
				drug sensitivity, increased pain sensitivity, prolonged sleep onset
				time, altered gene expression in the lymphocytes, signs of oxidative
				stress, slightly increased endothelin-1 plasma level, low body mass
				index and often diffuse and fluctuating visual field defects.
				Coldness, emotional or mechanical stress and starving can provoke
				symptoms. Virtually all organs, particularly the eye, can be
				involved. In subjects with PVD, retinal vessels are stiffer and more
				irregular, and both neurovascular coupling and autoregulation
				capacity are reduced while retinal venous pressure is often
				increased. Subjects with PVD have increased risk for normal-tension
				glaucoma, optic nerve compartment syndrome, central serous
				choroidopathy, Susac syndrome, retinal artery and vein occlusions
				and anterior ischaemic neuropathy without atherosclerosis. Further
				characteristics are their weaker blood- brain and blood-retinal
				barriers and the higher prevalence of optic disc haemorrhages and
				activated astrocytes. Subjects with PVD tend to suffer more often
				from tinnitus, muscle cramps, migraine with aura and silent
				myocardial ischaemic and are at greater risk for altitude sickness.
				While the main cause of vascular dysregulation is vascular
				endotheliopathy, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is also
				involved. In contrast, SVD occurs in the context of other diseases
				such as multiple sclerosis, retrobulbar neuritis, rheumatoid
				arthritis, fibromyalgia and giant cell arteritis. Taking into
				consideration the high prevalence of PVD in the population and
				potentially linked pathologies, in the current article, the authors
				provide recommendations on how to effectively promote the field in
				order to create innovative diagnostic tools to predict the pathology

				<h6>Title: The eye and the heart</h6>
				Date:2013 <br>Author: Flammer, J; Konieczka, K; Bruno, R M;
				Virdis, A; Flammer, A J; Taddei, S <br> <br> Abstract: The
				vasculature of the eye and the heart share several common
				characteristics. The easily accessible vessels of the eye are
				therefore-to some extent-a window to the heart. There is interplay
				between cardiovascular functions and risk factors and the occurrence
				and progression of many eye diseases. In particular, arteriovenous
				nipping, narrowing of retinal arteries, and the dilatation of
				retinal veins are important signs of increased cardiovascular risk.
				The pressure in the dilated veins is often markedly increased due to
				a dysregulation of venous out ow from the eye. Besides such
				morphological criteria, functional alterations might be even more
				relevant and may play an important role in future diagnosetics. Via
				neurovascular coupling, flickering light dilates capillaries and
				small arterioles, thus inducing endothelium-dependent, ow-mediated
				dilation of larger retinal vessels. Risk factors for
				arteriosclerosis, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes, or systemic
				hypertension, are also risk factors for eye diseases such as retinal
				arterial or retinal vein occlusions, cataracts, age-related macular
				degeneration, and increases in intraocular pressure (IOP).
				Functional alterations of blood ow are particularly relevant to the
				eye. The primary vascular dysregulation syndrome (PVD), which often
				includes systemic hypotension, is associated with disturbed
				autoregulation of ocular blood ow (OBF). Fluctuation of IOP on a
				high level or blood pressure on a low-level lead to instable OBF and
				oxygen supply and therefore to oxidative stress, which is
				particularly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous
				neuropathy. Vascular dysregulation also leads to a barrier
				dysfunction and thereby to small retinal haemorrhages. Published:

				<h6>Title: Diagnosis and Classification of Diseases from 1404
					Subjects via Pattern Analysis of Exhaled Molecules</h6>
				Date:2015 <br> Author: Morad K. Nakhleh,† Haitham Amal, Raneen
				Jeries,† Yoav Y. Broza<br> <br> Abstract: We report on an
				artificially intelligent nanoarray based on molecularly modified
				gold nanoparticles and a random network of single-walled carbon
				nanotubes for noninvasive diagnosis and classification of a number
				of diseases from exhaled breath. The performance of this
				artificially intelligent nanoarray was clinically assessed on breath
				samples collected from 1404 subjects having one of 17 different
				disease conditions included in the study or having no evidence of
				any disease (healthy controls). Blind experiments showed that 86%
				accuracy could be achieved with the artificially intelligent
				nanoarray, allowing both detection and discrimination between the
				different disease conditions examined. Analysis of the artificially
				intelligent nanoarray also showed that each disease has its own
				unique breathprint, and that the presence of one disease would not
				screen out others. Cluster analysis showed a reasonable
				classification power of diseases from the same categories. The
				effect of confounding clinical and environmental factors on the
				performance of the nanoarray did not significantly alter the
				obtained results. The diagnosis and classification power of the
				nanoarray was also validated by an independent analytical technique,
				i.e., gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometry. This
				analysis found that 13 exhaled chemical species, called volatile
				organic compounds, are associated with certain diseases, and the
				composition of this assembly of volatile organic compounds differs
				from one disease to another. Overall, these findings could
				contribute to one of the most important criteria for successful
				health intervention in the modern era, viz. easy-to-use, inexpensive
				(affordable), and miniaturized tools that could also be used for
				personalized screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of a number of
				diseases, which can clearly be extended by further development.

				<h6>Title: Human breath analysis may support the existence of
					individual metabolic phenotypes</h6>
				Date: 2013 <br> Author: Martinez-Lozano Sinues, Pablo; Kohler,
				Malcolm; Zenobi, Renato<br> <br> Abstract: The metabolic
				phenotype varies widely due to external factors such as diet and gut
				microbiome composition, among others. Despite these temporal
				fluctuations, urine metabolite profiling studies have suggested that
				there are highly individual phenotypes that persist over extended
				periods of time. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the exhaled
				breath of a group of subjects during nine days by mass spectrometry.
				Consistent with previous metabolomics studies based on urine, we
				conclude that individual signatures of breath composition exist. The
				confirmation of the existence of stable and specific breath prints
				may contribute to strengthen the inclusion of breath as a bio fluid
				of choice in metabolomics studies. In addition, the fact that the
				method is rapid and totally non-invasive, yet individualized
				profiles can be tracked, makes it an appealing approach.<br> <br>

				Dallmann, Robert<br> <br> Abstract: Circadian clocks play
				a significant role in the correct timing of physiological
				metabolism, and clock disruption might lead to pathological changes
				of metabolism. One interesting method to assess the current state of
				metabolism is metabolomics. Metabolomics tries to capture the
				entirety of small molecules, i.e. the building blocks of metabolism,
				in a given matrix, such as blood, saliva or urine. Using mass
				spectrometric approaches, we and others have shown that a
				significant portion of the human metabolome in saliva and blood
				exhibits circadian modulation; independent of food intake or
				sleep/wake rhythms. Recent advances in mass spectrometry techniques
				have introduced completely non-invasive breath printing; a method to
				instantaneously assess small metabolites in human breath. In this
				proof-of-principle study, we extend these findings about the impact
				of circadian clocks on metabolomics to exhaled breath. As previously
				established, our method allows for real-time analysis of a rich
				matrix during frequent non-invasive sampling. We sampled the breath
				of three healthy, non-smoking human volunteers in hourly intervals
				for 24 hours during total sleep deprivation, and found 111 features
				in the breath of all individuals, 36-49% of which showed significant
				circadian variation in at least one individual. Our data suggest
				that real-time mass spectrometric "breath printing" has high
				potential to become a useful tool to understand circadian
				metabolism, and develop new biomarkers to easily and in real-time
				assess circadian clock phase and function in experimental and
				clinical settings. <br> <br> Published: Martinez-Lozano

				Abstract: It has been suggested that exhaled breath contains
				relevant information on health status. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized
				that a novel mass spectrometry (MS) technique to analyze breath in
				real time could be useful to differentiate breath prints from
				chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and controls
				(smokers and nonsmokers). METHODS: We studied 61 participants
				including 25 COPD patients [Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung
				Disease (GOLD) stages I-IV], 25 nonsmoking controls and 11 smoking
				controls. We analyzed their breath by MS in real time. Raw mass
				spectra were then processed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A
				panel of discriminating mass-spectral features was identified for
				COPD (all stages; n = 25) versus healthy nonsmokers (n = 25), COPD
				(all stages; n = 25) versus healthy smokers (n = 11) and mild COPD
				(GOLD stages I/II; n = 13) versus severe COPD (GOLD stages III/IV; n
				= 12). A blind classification (i.e. leave-one-out cross validation)
				resulted in 96% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity (COPD vs. smoking
				controls), 88% sensitivity and 92% specificity (COPD vs. nonsmoking
				controls) and 92.3% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity (GOLD I/II vs.
				GOLD III/IV). Acetone and indole were identified as two of the
				discriminating exhaled molecules. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
				real-time MS may be a useful technique to analyze and characterize
				the metabolome of exhaled breath. The acquisition of breath prints
				in a rapid manner may be valuable to support COPD diagnosis and to
				gain insight into the disease.<br> <br> Published:

				Abstract: In recent years, breath analysis in real time has become a
				noninvasive alternative for the diagnosis of diseases and for
				molecular fingerprinting of exhaled breath. However, the techniques
				used lack the capabilities for proper identification of the
				compounds found in the exhalome. Here, we report the use of
				UHPLC-HRMS as a tool for the identification of several aldehydes
				(2-alkenals, 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, and 4-hydroxy-2,6-alkadienals),
				biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, in exhaled breath condensate of
				three healthy subjects (N = 3). Some of the aldehydes studied have
				never been identified before. Their robust identification is based
				on retention times, on the generation of fragmentation trees from
				tandem mass spectra, and on the comparison of these parameters with
				standards. We also show that the identified compounds can be
				analyzed and confirmed by MS/MS in breath in real time and,
				therefore, they could be used as biomarkers for the rapid and
				noninvasive diagnosis of related diseases.<br> <br>

				pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring of ketamine, propofol, and valproic
				acid, and their metabolites was achieved in mice, using secondary
				electrospray ionization and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The
				PK profile of a drug influences its efficacy and toxicity because it
				determines exposure time and levels. The antidepressant and
				anaesthetic ketamine (Ket) and four Ket metabolites were studied in
				detail and their PK was simultaneously determined following
				application of different sub-anaesthetic doses of Ket.
				Bioavailability after oral administration vs. intraperitoneal
				injection was also investigated. In contrast to conventional studies
				that require many animals to be sacrificed even for low-resolution
				PK curves, this novel approach yields real-time PK curves with a
				hitherto unmatched time resolution (10 s), and none of the animals
				has to be sacrificed. This thus represents a major step forward not
				only in animal welfare, but also major cost and time savings. <br>

				<br> Abstract: The identification of chemical compounds in
				exhaled human breath is promising in the search for new biomarkers
				of diseases. However, the analytical techniques used nowadays are
				not capable of achieving a robust identification, especially in
				real-time analysis. In this work, we show that real-time
				high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) is suitable for
				the identification of biomarkers in exhaled breath. Using this
				approach, we identified a number of furan derivatives, compounds
				found in the exhalome whose nature and origin are not yet clearly
				understood. It is also shown that the combination of HRMS/MS with
				UHPLC allowed not only the identification of the furan derivatives
				but also the proper separation of their isomeric forms.<br> <br>

				<br> Abstract: Online breath analysis is an attractive approach
				to track exhaled compounds without sample preparation. Current
				commercially available real-time breath analysis platforms require
				the purchase of a full mass spectrometer. Here we present an ion
				source compatible with virtually any preexisting atmospheric
				pressure ionization mass spectrometer that allows real-time analysis
				of breath. We illustrate the capabilities of such technological
				development by upgrading an orbitrap mass spectrometer. As a result,
				we detected compounds in exhaled breath between 70 and 900 Da, with
				a mass accuracy of typically&lsaquo;1 ppm; resolutions between m/Δm
				22,000 and 70,000 and fragmentation capabilities. The setup was
				tested in a pilot study, comparing the breath of smokers (n=9) and
				non-smokers (n=10). Exogenous compounds associated to smoking, as
				well as endogenous metabolites suggesting increased oxidative stress
				in smokers, were detected and in some cases identified
				unambiguously. Most of these compounds correlated significantly with
				smoking frequency and allowed accurate discrimination of smokers and
				non-smokers. <br> <br> Published: Gaugg MT, Gomez DG,
