				<h4>为中国定制的两项先进诊断技术</h4>

				<h5>1. Background</h5>
				Diagnostics always played a pivotal role in medicine: more precise
				diagnostics allow more effective treatment. At the Webpage of the
				Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) we find
				this text: “We should strengthen cooperation with neighboring
				countries on epidemic information sharing, the exchange of
				prevention and treatment technologies and the training of medical
				professionals, and improve our capability to jointly address public
				health emergencies. We will provide medical assistance and emergency
				medical aid to relevant countries, and carry out practical
				cooperation in maternal and child health, disability rehabilitation,
				and major infectious diseases including AIDS, tuberculosis and
				malaria. We will also expand cooperation on traditional medicine. <br />
				<br /> We should increase our cooperation in science and
				technology, establish joint labs (or research centers),
				international technology transfer centers and maritime cooperation
				centers, promote sci-tech personnel exchanges, cooperate in tackling
				key sci-tech problems, and work together to improve sci-tech
				innovation capability.” <br /> <br /> The two diagnostic methods
				shown below - Retinal Micro Blood-Vessel Analysis and Chemical
				Breath Analysis - are unique in their sensitivity and early disease
				detection capability; these translate directly into better treatment
				options - and often also in the prevention of the disease
				altogether. <br /> <br /> The two methods allow fast and accurate
				patient data collection and are well suited for screening of large
				numbers of people. Patients in risk groups can thus be tested
				frequently, and even slight changes in the condition can be quickly
				detected. <br /> <br /> In order to improve the accuracy and
				specificity of the two methods, an enlarged data base of correlated
				patient samples is required; to this end, we will invite suitable
				Chinese medical research institutions to work with us in
				systematically building up this data base. <br /> <br />
				<h5>2. Retinal Micro Blood-Vessel Analysis</h5>
				<h6>2.1. Introduction</h6>
				The vasculature of the eye and the heart share several common
				characteristics. The easily accessible vessels of the eye are
				therefore—to some extent—a window to the heart. There is interplay
				between cardiovascular functions and risk factors, and the
				occurrence and progression of many eye diseases. In particular,
				arteriovenous nipping, narrowing of retinal arteries, and the
				dilatation of retinal veins are important signs of increased
				cardiovascular risk. The pressure in the dilated veins is often
				markedly increased due to a dysregulation of venous outflow from the
				eye. Besides such morphological criteria, functional alterations
				might be even more relevant and may play an important role in future
				diagnostics.(J. Flammer） <br /> <br />
				<h6>2.2. The Science of Microvessel Analysis</h6>
				The vasculature of the heart and retinal vessels share several
				common characteristics, and undergo similar changes during
				dysfunctional progression.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> The retina offers a
				convenient site for the imaging and detection of microvascular
				changes over time. The underlying science of the micro blood vessel
				analysis of the retina is based on the observation that
				cardio-vascular problems and diseases are first seen in the micro
				vessels and only after a relatively long time also show up in the
				large vessels; when a cardio-vascular problem is detected in the
				micro vessels of the retina, but not yet in the large vessels, it is
				a predictive indication of increased vascular risk, and there is
				usually ample time left to initiate corrective measures to lessen or
				completely avoid the break-out of the disease. <br /> <br />
				<h6>2.3. The History and Development of Microvessel Analysis</h6>
				Micro Blood-Vessel Analysis has its roots in the USA and Europe, and
				has been further developed specifically in Germany and Switzerland.<sup>[4]</sup>
				Statistical research started 20 years ago in the USA by Larry
				Hubbard (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study), where
				protocols have been developed for nonmydriatic fundus photography
				and for evaluation of retinal vascular abnormalities. The broad
				study showed risk factors for heart attack and inflammation of blood
				vessels. The ARIC study, and also the Rotterdam study, were two of
				many studies focusing on Micro Blood-Vessel Analysis.<sup>[5]
					[6] [7] [8] [9] [10]</sup> <br /> <br /> About 25 years ago, Dr.
				Walthard Vilser initiated Dynamic Vessel Analysis (DVA) at
				Friedrich-Schiller-University at Jena; Dr. Vilser then started his
				own company and began to manufacture high-precision optical
				equipment. Prof. J.Flammer used Dr. Vilser's equipment to compare
				venous blood pressure vs. arterial blood pressure in the
				micro-vessels of the eye; he combined retinal DVA (Dynamic Vessel
				Analysis) and retinal Venal analysis, and for the first time
				recognized the vascular cause of glaucoma.<sup>[2]</sup> <br /> <br />
				<h6>2.4. The Methods of Microvessel Analysis</h6>
				Microvessel Analysis can be divided into two main segments: Static
				Micro Vessel Analysis (Figure 1), and Dynamic Micro Vessel Analysis
				(Figure 2). <br /> <img src="images/f1_1.png"><img
					src="images/f1_2.png"> <br /> Figure 1: Static Micro Vessel
				Analysis <br /> <img src="images/f2_1.png"> <img
					src="images/f2_2.png"> <br /> Figure 2: Dynamic Micro Vessel
				Analysis <br /> Static Micro Vessel Analysis analyses the micro
				blood vessels of the retina statically, i.e. based on still images
				taken with a specialized camera, while Dynamic Micro Vessel Analysis
				analyses the micro blood vessels of the retina dynamically. In the
				dynamic vessel analysis, the vessel diameters are determined not
				only as a function of the place in an individual frame but in
				addition also continuously as a function of time in a live video. <sup>[11]</sup>
				<br /> <br />
				<h6>2.5. The Tools of Microvessel Analysis</h6>
				The tools we propose are Imedos Retina Cameras: (Figure 3) <br />
				(a) <img src="images/f3_1.png"> <br /> (b) <img
					src="images/f3_2.png"> <br /> Figure 3: Main components of
				the (a) Static and (b) Dynamic Vessel Analysis systems <br /> <br />
				<h6>2.6. The Maturity of Microvessel Analysis</h6>
				Both static and dynamic micro blood vessel analysis have reached a
				level of maturity which today allows early diagnostics of
				cardio-vascular problems – many years (5-15) before the problems
				actually break out. Early-generation equipment is already on the
				market, but it is still mainly used in ophthalmology; only a few
				research institutes have begun to use the equipment for general
				cardiovascular analysis and disease prevention. <br /> <br />
				<h5>3. Chemical Breath Analysis</h5>
				<h6>3.1. Introduction</h6>
				Breath analysis is the development of core technologies and
				methodologies for the safe, sensitive, fast and inexpensive analysis
				of exhaled breath. Breath analysis is a highly promising diagnostic
				tool that allows rapid monitoring of biochemical parameters in real
				time and in a non-invasive way. It therefore has the potential to
				simplify diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases, and may at
				some point replace analyses that are currently performed on blood or
				urine samples. <br /> <br />

				diseases, and may at some point replace analyses that are currently
				performed on blood or urine samples.<br /> <br />
				<h6>3.2. The Science of Chemical Breath Analysis</h6>
				Sample preparation for diagnostic purposes directly from the lung
				may be difficult. But exhaled breath is a unique window to the
				internal metabolism of the body, which can be analyzed with very
				high sensitivity and selectivity. Mass spectrometry allows the
				highest accuracy for the determination of chemical compounds with
				very little sample consumption. In the 1970s, Linus Pauling´s study
				of exhaled breath using GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass
				spectrography) initiated the interest in breath analysis.<sup>[15]</sup>
				The underlying science of Chemical Breath Analysis is based on the
				observation that in each exhaled breath of a human and animal is a
				wealth of information in the form of chemicals; these chemicals are
				found usually only in minute quantities. With new equipment based on
				well-proven mass spectrography – but specifically developed for this
				purpose - minute quantities of a given chemical can be detected.<br />
				<br />
				<h6>3.3. The History of Chemical Breath Analysis</h6>
				Detecting human disease by odor has a long history. From Hippocrates
				to Traditional Chinese Medicine to Lavoisier, and since ca. 10 years
				it is the object of intense studies at ETH Zurich.<sup>[16]</sup><br />
				<br /> There, the most sensitive instruments to date have been
				developed to analyze the chemical components of human breath.<sup>[17][18]19][20][21][22][23]</sup>
				Many researchers and institutes are trying very hard to develop
				breath diagnosis technology with the support of the US, European
				Union, Israel and so on. In 2015，the team coming from Israel
				Institute of Technology declared that they had developed a breath
				diagnosis technology named NoNose which could detect 17 diseases.<sup>[24]</sup>
				<br /> <br />
				<h6>3.4. The Methods of Chemical Breath Analysis</h6>
				The breath of the patient/customer is exhaled into the entry tube of
				the aerosol ionizer under normal pressure; there the breath is
				ionized and passed on to the ultra-vacuum of the mass spectrograph.
				(Figure 4) <br /> <img src="images/f4.png"><br />Figure 4:
				Schematic drawing of SESI ionizer<br /><br /> <img src="images/f5.png"><br />
				Figure 5: The aerosol ionizer interfaced with a mass spectrometer
				for the breath analysis <br />
				<br />
				<h6>3.5. The Tools of Chemical Breath Analysis</h6>

				The tools we propose to use for chemical breath analysis are aerosol
				ionizers by the ETH spin-off FIT. The Secondary Electro-Spray
				Ionization (SESI) manufactured by FIT uses an electrospray that
				produces a cloud of charging ions. These ions ionize the vapors that
				are in contact with the cloud. The charge transfer reactions are
				specific, very efficient, and very soft (no high energies involved).
				As a result, SESI enables: <br />- a very high ionization
				efficiency,<br /> - soft ionization of polar species with no
				fragmentation, and <br />- an instantaneous response.<br /> <br />

				<h6>3.6. The Maturity of Chemical Breath Analysis</h6>
				Chemical Breath Analysis is still in its early stage of development.
				The equipment required to find minute quantities of a given molecule
				in the human breath exists today but is still very expensive and
				complex. Many problems still need to be solved, like the problem of
				the heavy molecules in the exhaled breath sticking to the instrument
				walls. The newly developed hardware can overcome the problem of
				ionizing aerosols and prepare them in a way suitable for most
				standard mass spectrographs; to analyze the vast amount of data
				resulting from each breath submitted to the ionizer, specific
				pattern recognition software was developed. <br />
